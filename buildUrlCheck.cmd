@echo off
rem ===================================================================
rem buildUrlCheck.cmd -- build urlCheck.exe from urlCheck.py and the Homer
rem Python package in C:\HomerDev.
rem
rem urlCheck is a Windows console program with a WinForms dialog (through
rem pythonnet) that drives the system's Microsoft Edge through Playwright and
rem axe-core. Its dialog is the kit's C# LbcDialog, loaded from Homer.dll
rem through homer.lbcnet. This build is the kit's Python template,
rem Templates\build_APP_Py.cmd, with its SETTINGS filled in for urlCheck, plus
rem one section of its own that carries over what the layout before the kit
rem left behind.
rem
rem Edge is not fetched: urlCheck uses the installed Edge through Playwright's
rem channel "msedge", and "playwright install msedge" fails where Edge is
rem already present, which is everywhere urlCheck runs.
rem
rem IT KEEPS THE SAME CONTRACT AS THE C# BUILD (kit 1.43.6), so a Python
rem app is a Homer app on the same terms:
rem   - finds the kit, and stops with a plain message when the kit is older
rem     than kitNeeded, telling a parse failure from an old kit;
rem   - version.txt is the single source of truth: stepped on every build
rem     (nobump keeps it), seeded when missing from the app's own number or
rem     its newest release tag, never from 1.0.0 over a released app, and
rem     written into version.py so the running program reports it;
rem   - the program goes to exec\, as in the installed tree; PyInstaller's
rem     scratch goes to work\, never beside the source;
rem   - the kit's Python package is NOT copied: PyInstaller is pointed at
rem     the kit with --paths and each module is named with --hidden-import,
rem     so the .exe carries the kit's current code;
rem   - the kit tools this app uses are refreshed into scripts\ and retired
rem     ones deleted, saying so when the kit lacks one;
rem   - documents: every .md at the top and in help\ gets its .htm when the
rem     .htm is missing or older; then fixEncoding puts every file the
rem     project names into the Homer encoding;
rem   - every file in help\ and every scripts\install*.cmd must be named by
rem     a Source: line of urlCheck_setup.iss, or the build stops;
rem   - the installer is compiled with /DHomerDev=<kit>;
rem   - one log per run: logs\urlCheck-build-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.log. The console
rem     says briefly what is happening; the log holds every command and
rem     its exit code.
rem
rem   buildUrlCheck          steps the version, then builds
rem   buildUrlCheck nobump   keeps the current number
rem
rem A running copy of the program is never closed. The build says so and
rem stops only when the copy running is exec\urlCheck.exe from THIS project,
rem which cannot be replaced while it runs; an installed copy under Program
rem Files is no concern of the build's.
rem
rem PARSE-TIME PITFALL: the variable NAME ProgramFiles(x86) contains
rem parentheses, and cmd.exe scans a parenthesised block for its closing
rem paren BEFORE expanding variables. The name is copied into progFiles86
rem outside any block, and only !progFiles86! is used inside one.
